# Preliminaries: Installing libraries and downloading data   

The preliminary requirements of the exam are the following:  

“*Before building the code, you need to install the required libraries.*  

*The libraries needed for the code are:*  

*`requests` - The library used for accessing the information from the URL.*  

*`bs4` - The library containing the BeautifulSoup function used for webscraping.*  

*`pandas` - The library used for processing the extracted data, storing it in required formats, and communicating with the databases.*  

*`sqlite3` - The library required to create a database server connection.*  

*`numpy` - The library required for the mathematical rounding operations.*  

*`datetime` - The library containing the function datetime used for extracting the timestamp for logging purposes.*”  

Based on such instruction, we must start our code with the following lines.  

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import sqlite3
from datetime import datetime
```
